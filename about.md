Hi, I'm Andrey Bagrov, .NET software engineer. I specialize in using ASP.NET Core, databases (SQL Server, Postgres, Redis), frontends (Angular, WPF) and love the challenge of creating high-quality software applications. I'm passionate about programming, and I enjoy sharing my knowledge and expertise through this blog. Contributing to the C# community is important to me, and I'm always on the lookout for ways to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies.
